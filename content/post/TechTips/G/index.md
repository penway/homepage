## Two Tasks: Online Behavioral Task and fMRI Task
- Core Task: conflict condition (common in both tasks)
    - Two signs to choose:
        1. 80% high money; 80% painful but bearable shock to others
        2. 80% low money; 80% non-painful shock to others
    - taken both online and in fMRI
- b: Conflict task: (i.e. high money, painful shock to others)
    - 10 trails that all information is given to the subject
    - 10 trails that only the outcome of money or pain is given to the subject
    - subjects will be exlicitly asked to report the learning associations
- c: Non-conflict task (i.e. high money also lead to low shock)
    - same structure as conflict task
    - to check whether the subjects can learn the associations


## Results

The choice of 'Considerate' 'Ambiguous' and 'Lucrative' distributed like a Gaussian in Online, while in fMRI, more people choose to be 'Considerate'.

The learning curve of 'Considerate' and 'Lucrative' is different, in the first trial, the choice are 50%, while progressively going up to 80%, which align with the expectation of RLT (with a 20/80 probability). While the learning curve of 'Ambiguous' almost remains the same.
