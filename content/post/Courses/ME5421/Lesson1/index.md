## Start of Lesson 1

Overview:

Advice: understand all the time, ask questions at real-time!
understand + pratice problem solving
try sample questions3
contact TA for research

[ME, EE, CS] + Social Science (Understand Humanity) + Business (Commercial) + Ethics

Robots do
Things that
- dangerous
- dull
- dirty
- degrading
- demeaning
- driving
( too intelligent to do )

- precision
( Human cannot do as well as machine )

Autonomous Driving is both!

Sensing+Understanding, Planning, Exceuting, Learning

Kinematics

manipulater:
  hand: end-effecter
  embrace: whole body manipulation

Base(Link0) - Joint1 - Link1 - Joint2 - Link2
Joints: Sliding-Translational, Rotating-Rotational

The space reachable by last link is called the workspace(sometimes, arm workspace)

Arm (primarily resposible for corase positioning) link 123(Cartesian Robot) + Wrist (fine positioning) link 456

Orientation worksapce: set of all possible orientations reachable

Cartesian Robot: 
Cylinrical Robot: RTT RRR
Spherical Robot: RRT RRR
So when we are talking about spherical or cylindrical or cartesian robot, we are talking about the first 3 links, i.e. arm workspace
( sometimes changing size of link will be same in kinematics, but not in dynamics )

### SCARA: Selective Compliant Assembly Robot Arm: RRT RRR; ISO 8373:2012

accerleration: m + b + k + G
(mass: overcome inertia, damping: overcome friction (air, water, etc.), stiffness, gravity)

SCARA can be fast because the first two links do not need to overcome gravity
GearBox(theta_N to theta_1): more torque, less speed, (most of the motor has gearbox, which are not back-drivable, or else it will be back-drivable)
Advantage for back-drivable: motor-generator; human-robot interaction; hitting will turned into voltage change, providing compliance
So SCARA is seletivly comliant, the first two links are back-drivable
Back-drivable with gearbox: add a sensor (put is a the end of the pole)


### Articulated Robot Arm: RRR RRR
rotational joint can change orientation and position at the same time while prismatic joint can only change position
Human is fully articulated (waist, shoulder, elbow, wrist, fingers)
joint style + joint range motion
6 joints because 6 DOF, 6 independent variables -> 6 DOF
sphereal joint = 3 DOF! because 3 independent variables (human shoulder, wrist)
if you have more joints that 6, you can have () motion, like stay your hand put but moving elbow, which is great


### Parallel Robot
like with two arms
increase payload, increase stiffness

### Service Robot
### Collaborative Robot Co-X CoBot
ISO: robot will stop when hit something
universal robot will sense the current to stop, but not very accurate, and it is not back-drivable
impedance control: if you have force torque sensors in joints, you can control the dynamics that is not physical
appearant mass, appearant stiffness, appearant damping
