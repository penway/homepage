Hightlight: sensor and actuator, material is because of that
Shape memory alloy, electrical material

Robotic material: maerial engineering cares about many aspects of the material, while science cares maybe only one aspect of the material, like superconductivity

Conventional Matrial: Arm, leg, body: mechanical properties are important

Advanced Robotic Materials:
maybe the material expand to push, 
some material can change shape on change of electric field (mechanical field and electrical field. more: thermal field, chemical field)

Page 9: Robotic Matrial can mean putting up a lot of materials together to make a **system**.
