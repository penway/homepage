## 5 Common Types of Robots
1. Autonomous Mobile Robot
2. Automated Guided Vehicle
    - tracks / predefined paths, and operator oversight
3. Articulated Robot (Robot Arm)
    - 2 to 10 R joints
4. Humanoid Robot
5. Cobots (Collaborative Robots)
    - Function alongside human
    - or directly with human

## Design Process
1. Client Statement (Requirements)
2. Problem Definition
    - Clarify objectives
    - Establish user requirements
    - Identify constraints
    - Establish functions
3. Conceptual Design
    - Establish design specifications
    - Generate alternatives
4. Preliminary Design
    - Model and analyze design
    - Test and evaluate design
5. Detailed Design
    - Refine and optimize design
6. Design Communication
    - Document design
7. Final Design
    - Fabrication specification and documentation

## Purchase
1. Raw Materials
    - Metals (Ferro vs Non-Ferro)
        - Aluminum Alloy, Steel
        - Strong, Rigid, Hard, Tough
    - Polymers (Thermoplastics vs Thermosets)
        - Acrylic(polymethyl methacrylate, 丙烯), PVC(polyvinyl chloride, 聚氯乙烯), ABS(Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, 丙烯腈-丁二烯-苯乙烯共聚物), HDPE(high-density polyethylene, 高密度聚乙烯)
        - Water Proof, Corrosion Proof, Resistant to Chemical Attack, Transparent, Electrical Insulation, Poor Head Conductivity
    - Ceramics (Crystalline vs Glass)
    - Composites (Fiber-reinforced vs Particulate)
        - Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer
        - strong, light weight, non-isotropy
2. Parts
    - Gear, Srew, Spring, etc
    - 
3. Components
    - Sensor, Energy Sources, Motors, Microcontrollers, etc

## Manufacturing
Definition: the application of physical and chemical processes to alter the geometry, properties, and/or appearance of a starting material to make parts or products

It also includes assembly of multiple parts to make products

### Shaping Processes
1. Solidification(固化), for liquid/semi-fluid
    - casting(铸造) and molding(模压)
2. Particulate(颗粒), for powder
    - start with metal or ceramic powder
    - pressing(压制), sintering(烧结), and powder metallurgy(粉末冶金)
3. Deformation, for ductile material
    - extrusion(挤压), rolling(轧制), forging(锻造), and drawing(拉伸)
    - thermoforming(热成型)
4. Material Removal, for brittle/ductile material
    - Machining(机械加工): Lathe(车床), Milling(铣床), Drilling(钻床), Grinding(磨床), Laser Cutting(激光切割)

### Choose a Manufacturing Process
1. Product Characteristics
    - Complexity
2. Material
3. Volumn(数量)/Cost(成本)
4. Lead Time(交货时间)

## Assembly
1. Joining
    - welding(焊接), brazing(钎焊), soldering(焊锡), adhesive bonding(粘接)
2. Mechanical Assembly
