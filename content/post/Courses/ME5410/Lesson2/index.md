why metal is good conductor? Because the the core of the atom for a structure, but the electron is not associated with one atom, but can move freely

most of the time, pure metal is better than alloy in terms of conductivity, but alloy is better in terms of strength, so we need to balance the two in the design of long distance power line (p25)
