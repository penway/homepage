# Chapter 1
## Exercise 1.1: Self-Play
**Q**: Suppose, instead of playing against a random opponent, the reinforcement learning algorithm described above played against itself. What do you think would happen in this case? Would it learn a different way of playing?

**A**: It would learn a different strategy because it will try to beat it self. The strategy might be contineously changing because the "enemy" is growing with the agent. So it can learn a different way of playing. However, I think this might not leading it into a better situation because the opponent is very limited into a simple strategy. If the system is well designed like AlphaGO Zero, it will work.

**GPT**: Your answer reflects the interesting nature of self-play in reinforcement learning, and it does indeed provide some insights. However, there are some additional complexities that may be considered. 

When an RL agent is pitted against itself, both versions of the agent are continuously learning from each other. This can create a more competitive and challenging environment that might lead the agent to discover more refined or sophisticated strategies, as each agent continually adapts to the strategies of the other.

However, there are potential pitfalls. Depending on the learning algorithm and exploration strategy used, self-play might lead to convergence on suboptimal strategies or cycling between different strategies without clear improvement. These risks are particularly evident if the learning algorithm is overly aggressive in adapting to recent experiences, which might lead to overfitting to the particular opponent's behavior (in this case, itself) without finding a generally strong strategy.

In some cases, self-play has been highly successful, as demonstrated by programs like AlphaGo Zero, where the agent learned to play Go at a superhuman level entirely through self-play. However, these successes often involve careful algorithmic design, tuning, and regularization to avoid the potential pitfalls mentioned above.

In conclusion, self-play can be a powerful tool for developing strong strategies, but it is not without risks and complexities. A successful application of self-play usually requires thoughtful consideration of the learning algorithm, exploration strategy, and other factors that might influence the learning process.

## Exercise 1.2: Symmetries
**Q**: Many tic-tac-toe positions appear different but are really the same because of symmetries. How might we amend the reinforce-ment learning algorithm described above to take advantage of this? In what ways would this improve it? Now think again. Suppose the opponent did not take advantage of symmetries. In that case, should we? Is it true, then, that symmetrically equivalent positions should necessarily have the same value?

**A**:
1. Amendment: Adding this prior into the agent. Design a set of trasmformation like mirror and rotation. After every move, try if we can transform the existing move into a prior moved place.
2. Improvement?: Yes, through this method it will largely shrink the space the strategy. So it will make the optimization easier.
3. We will still use this.
4. Yes, they can have the same value. Bacause the are exactly the same case.

**GPT**:
You've identified the key concept of using symmetries in tic-tac-toe to reduce the state space and potentially speed up learning. Let's delve into each part of your answer.

1. **Amendment**: Utilizing transformations like mirror and rotation to recognize symmetrically equivalent states is a good approach. By mapping these states to a canonical representation, the learning algorithm can treat them as the same state. This can help the agent to generalize more quickly from its experiences.

2. **Improvement**: By exploiting symmetries, the agent can indeed reduce the state space, making learning more efficient. It allows the agent to recognize that experiences in one state can apply to other symmetrically equivalent states, thus needing fewer samples to learn a good policy.

3. **Should We Still Use This if the Opponent Doesn't?**: Even if the opponent does not take advantage of symmetries, using them can still be beneficial for the reasons mentioned above. It simplifies the learning task without losing any relevant information.

4. **Should Symmetrically Equivalent Positions Have the Same Value?**: While it is tempting to say that symmetrically equivalent positions should have the same value, this might not always be the case if the opponent behaves differently in these positions. If the opponent does not recognize and act identically in symmetric situations, the value of those positions could indeed differ. In playing against an irrational or inconsistent opponent, recognizing symmetries might not always lead to identical value assessments.

Your answer captures the essential idea of leveraging symmetries in tic-tac-toe to enhance the learning process, but **considering the opponent's behavior adds an extra layer of complexity that could affect the equivalence of symmetric states**.
