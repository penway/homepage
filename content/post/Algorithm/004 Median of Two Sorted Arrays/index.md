## Description

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return **the median** of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.

## First Thought

It would be pretty easy just to use a O(n) merge and then pick the middle point. However, this problem requires a O(log (m+n)) time complexity.

I haven't come up with the solution and searched online and it explains this problem crestal clear:

[Median of two sorted arrays with different sizes in O(log(min(n, m))) - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median-two-sorted-arrays-different-sizes-ologminn-m/)

I'll try to explain it myself (, as a practice of English writing).
