I am widely interested in technologies about computer science and machenical engineering. I am also interested in computational neuroscience and cognitive science.
Apart from course projects, I am currently studying on:
- Transformer and Generative Models
- Computaional Neuroscience

Examples of my projects:
- Research on knee angle estimation based on whole-body motion capture data (2023-now)
- Combustion Formula Student Race Car (Technical Director and Suspension Engineer, 2019-2022)
- Research on Image Generation Method Based on Convolutional Neural Network (2023, Graduation Paper, top 5%)
- Website of a weight management and parts management system (2022) |
